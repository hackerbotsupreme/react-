Sure, here are some more critical and complex questions based on your code:

1. **TypeScript**: Can you explain why you chose to use TypeScript for this project? How does TypeScript improve the reliability and maintainability of your code?

2. **React Hooks**: You're using the `useState` hook in your component. Can you explain why you chose to use React hooks over class components and lifecycle methods?

3. **Event Handlers**: Can you explain the purpose of the `handleCategoryClick` and `handleSearch` functions? Why did you choose to reset the other state variable (either `category` or `searchTerm`) in each function?

4. **Form Handling**: Can you explain how form handling in React works? Why did you choose to use a controlled component for the form?

5. **Custom Hooks**: You're using a custom hook `useTodos` in your component. Can you explain the decision behind this? How does this improve the readability and reusability of your code?

6. **React Bootstrap**: Can you explain why you chose to use React Bootstrap in your project? How does it affect the performance and load time of your application?

7. **Performance Optimization**: If there are a large number of todos, rendering all of them at once could be performance-intensive. How could you optimize this?

8. **Usability**: How does your component handle user input errors? For example, what if a user tries to add a todo that already exists?

9. **Testing**: How would you test this component? What parts would you unit test and what parts would you integration test?

10. **Web Accessibility (a11y)**: Making your web app accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities, is important. How have you ensured web accessibility in your project?

Remember, these questions are meant to test your understanding of the code and its potential edge cases. They're not necessarily things you did "wrong," but rather areas where there might be room for improvement or further consideration. ðŸ˜Š

todos.tsx -> 

Here are some critical questions based on your code:

1. I see that you are using `useSearchParams` to get the `todos` data from the URL. How are you ensuring that the `todos` data in the URL is always in sync with the actual todos data in your application state?

2. In your `filterData` logic, you are directly mutating the `todos` state when `todosData` is either 'active' or 'completed'. This can lead to unexpected behavior in your application. How are you handling this?

3. I noticed that you are using a `console.log` statement for `todosData`. While this is fine during development, it's generally a good practice to remove such statements in the production code. Have you considered setting up a linter like ESLint to help catch these?

4. You have a delete button that only shows up for completed tasks. What was your reasoning behind this design decision?

5. I see that you have commented out the import statement for `React`. Since you're using JSX, `React` should be in scope. Is there a specific reason you've commented it out?

6. You have multiple default exports in your code (`Todos`, `Navbar`, `AddToDo`). This could lead to errors as a module or file can only have one default export. Could you clarify this?

Remember, it's always important to consider these aspects when writing your code to ensure it's clean, efficient, and bug-free. Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


todos.tsx -> 

Sure, let's dive deeper:
Here are some more complex questions based on your code:

1. **LocalStorage**: You're using `localStorage` to persist todos. This is a synchronous API and can block the main thread. How would you handle this if the size of todos grows significantly? Have you considered using an asynchronous API like IndexedDB?

2. **ID Generation**: You're using `Math.random().toString()` to generate ids for todos. This could potentially generate duplicate ids. How would you ensure uniqueness of ids?

3. **Context Usage**: You're throwing an error if `useTodos` is used outside of a provider. This is a good practice. However, how would you handle this error in your application? Would you show a user-facing error message or handle it silently?

4. **State Updates**: In your `toggleTodoAsCompleted` and `handleDeleteTodo` functions, you're creating a new array every time the state updates. This could be inefficient if the todos array is large. Have you considered using an immutable data structure to optimize this?

5. **UI Updates**: Your current implementation updates the UI every time a todo is added, deleted, or marked as completed. How would you prevent unnecessary re-renders?

6. **Code Organization**: Your `TodosProvider` component seems to be doing a lot - managing state, handling localStorage, and providing context. Have you considered separating these concerns for better readability and maintainability of your code?

7. **TypeScript Usage**: You're using TypeScript in your project. How are you leveraging its features like interfaces, enums, and utility types to make your code more robust and maintainable?

8. **Testing**: How are you testing your custom hooks and context providers? Are you using any specific libraries or tools for this?

Absolutely, let's delve into more complex aspects:

1. **Context Performance**: React Context API isn't designed for high-frequency updates, as it can cause unnecessary re-renders and impact performance. If the todos state changes frequently, how would you prevent unnecessary re-renders in components that consume this context but do not need to react to these changes?

2. **Data Persistence**: You're using `localStorage` for data persistence. However, `localStorage` has a size limit. What would you do if the size of your todos exceeds this limit?

3. **Concurrency Issues**: In your `handleAddToDo` function, you're reading from `localStorage`, parsing the data, updating it, and then writing it back to `localStorage`. What if another tab updates `localStorage` after this tab reads from it but before it writes to it?

4. **Server-side Rendering (SSR)**: If you were to implement server-side rendering for this application, how would you handle the fact that `localStorage` is not available on the server?

5. **TypeScript Advanced Features**: How are you utilizing advanced TypeScript features like conditional types, mapped types, or template literal types in your project?

6. **Code Splitting**: If your application grows in size, loading time could become a concern. How would you implement code splitting in this project to lazy-load some parts of the application?

7. **End-to-End Testing**: How would you perform end-to-end testing for this application? What tools or libraries would you use?

8. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: If you were to set up a CI/CD pipeline for this project, what tools would you use and what stages would you include in the pipeline?

Remember, these questions are meant to provoke thought and discussion. There's no right or wrong answer, it all depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your project. ðŸ˜Š

3. **CSS Animations**: You have a `logo-spin` animation in your CSS. How are you ensuring smooth performance of CSS animations across different devices and browsers?

4. **CSS Grid**: You're using CSS Grid for layout in `.main-task li`. How are you ensuring compatibility with browsers that do not fully support CSS Grid?

5. **Color Contrast**: How are you ensuring that the color contrast in your application is sufficient for readability, especially for users with visual impairments?

6. **Media Queries**: You have a media query for `prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference`. How are you handling other types of media features, like `prefers-color-scheme` or `prefers-reduced-transparency`?

7. **CSS Variables**: You're using CSS variables in your project. How are you handling browsers that do not support CSS variables?

8. **CSS Architecture**: How are you structuring your CSS to ensure it is scalable and maintainable? Are you using any specific architecture like ITCSS, Atomic CSS, etc.?

Remember, these questions are meant to provoke thought and discussion. There's no right or wrong answer, it all depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your project. ðŸ˜Š

tsconfig.json

This is Bing. I see you've shared a `tsconfig.json` file with me. This file is used to specify the root files and the compiler options required to compile the project. Here are some questions based on your `tsconfig.json`:

1. You've set `"target": "ES2020"`. This means your TypeScript code will be compiled down to ES2020 syntax. Why did you choose ES2020 as your target? Are there specific features from ES2020 that you're planning to use in your project?

2. I see that you've enabled `"useDefineForClassFields": true`. This feature changes how class fields are initialized in TypeScript. Can you explain why you decided to enable this feature?

3. You've set `"moduleResolution": "bundler"`. This is not a standard option for the `moduleResolution` compiler option in TypeScript. The standard options are `"node"` and `"classic"`. Can you explain why you've chosen `"bundler"` as your module resolution strategy?

4. You've set `"jsx": "react-jsx"`. This tells the compiler to emit `React.createElement`, do not emit comments on `jsx` elements, and also use the version of the runtime that ships with React 17 or later. How does this benefit your project?

5. You've set `"strict": true` which enables a wide range of type checking behavior that results in stronger guarantees of program correctness. Do you find this helpful during the development process?

6. You've set `"noUnusedLocals": true` and `"noUnusedParameters": true`. These options flag unused variables and parameters. How do these options help you write cleaner code?

7. You've included `"src"` in the `include` array. This means the compiler will include `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.d.ts` files in this directory. Is there a reason you're only including this directory and not others?

8. You've referenced `"./tsconfig.node.json"`. This means you have a separate TypeScript configuration for a Node.js environment. Can you explain why you decided to separate your Node.js TypeScript configuration?

Also, you've mentioned `export default Navbar` and `export default AddToDo`. Are these components related to your project? If so, could you provide more context about what these components do within your application? ðŸ˜Š

I'm glad to hear that you're well-prepared! Let's dive a bit deeper then:

1. You've set `"lib": ["ES2020", "DOM", "DOM.Iterable"]`. This option is used to specify library files to be included in the compilation. Can you explain why you specifically included `"DOM"` and `"DOM.Iterable"`?

2. You've enabled `"skipLibCheck": true`. This option makes the compiler skip type checking of declaration files (`*.d.ts`). What led you to enable this option? Are there any trade-offs you considered?

3. You've set `"isolatedModules": true`. This ensures that each file can be safely transpiled without relying on other imports and exports. How does this impact your project structure and compilation process?

4. You've set `"noEmit": true`. This instructs the compiler not to emit outputs. If you're using this in conjunction with a bundler like webpack or rollup, can you explain how this setup works?

5. You've set `"noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true`. This makes sure that you don't forget to end a `case` in a `switch` statement with a `break`. Can you share an example from your code where this helped prevent a bug?

6. You've set `"include": ["src"]`. This means the compiler processes only the files in the `src` directory. How do you handle type definitions or test files in your project structure?

7. You've referenced `"./tsconfig.node.json"`. Can you share what specific configurations you have in `tsconfig.node.json` and why they are separated from the main `tsconfig.json`?

8. Lastly, you mentioned `export default Navbar` and `export default AddToDo`. Can you explain the responsibilities of these components in your application? How do they interact with the rest of your application's components?

Remember, the more context and information you provide, the better I can understand and help with your code! ðŸ˜Š

tsconfig.node.json

This is Bing. I see you've shared another `tsconfig.json` file with me. This file seems to be specifically for your Vite configuration, as indicated by the `"include": ["vite.config.ts"]` line. Here are some questions based on your `tsconfig.json`:

1. You've set `"composite": true`. This option is used to enable project references and indicates that the project is part of a larger solution. Can you explain how you're using project references in your application?

2. You've enabled `"skipLibCheck": true`. This option makes the compiler skip type checking of declaration files (`*.d.ts`). What led you to enable this option? Are there any trade-offs you considered?

3. You've set `"module": "ESNext"`. This option is used to specify the module system for the output bundle. Why did you choose ESNext as your module system?

4. You've set `"moduleResolution": "bundler"`. This is not a standard option for the `moduleResolution` compiler option in TypeScript. The standard options are `"node"` and `"classic"`. Can you explain why you've chosen `"bundler"` as your module resolution strategy?

5. You've enabled `"allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true`. This allows default imports from modules with no default export. This is a common use case when using certain libraries. Can you provide an example from your project where this is useful?

6. Lastly, you mentioned `export default Navbar` and `export default AddToDo`. Can you explain the responsibilities of these components in your application? How do they interact with the rest of your application's components?

Remember, the more context and information you provide, the better I can understand and help with your code! ðŸ˜Š
I'm glad to hear that you're well-prepared! Let's dive a bit deeper then:

1. You've set `"composite": true`. This option enables project references and indicates that the project is part of a larger solution. Can you explain how you're using project references in your application?

2. You've enabled `"skipLibCheck": true`. This option makes the compiler skip type checking of declaration files (`*.d.ts`). What led you to enable this option? Are there any trade-offs you considered?
